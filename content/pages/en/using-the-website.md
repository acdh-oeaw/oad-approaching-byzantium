## Places in Ottoman Istanbul

The map on the home page shows places in Constantinople and its surroundings, which are mentioned in the travel accounts or depicted in the images. The main focus is on the historical peninsula of Constantinople, but the former Genoese settlement of Pera-Galata, the district of Hasköy, the boroughs of Eyüp, Üsküdar (Chrysopolis), and Kadıköy (Chalcedon), the Thracian hinterland, the shores of the Bosporus, and the Princes Islands are also included. By clicking on the points on the map, the user will be able to see the names of the sites included. Clicking on each name will open a side bar with the data relevant to the site in question: basic facts about its use and history and a list of sources which mention or depict it, as well as a list of events (mostly visits to the respective monuments). 

The list of places includes Byzantine and Ottoman sites attested in the 16th-century textual and visual sources compiled by travelers from the Holy Roman Empire. For each place there is a concise description regarding its history and location, as well as its condition and use during the 16th century. For Ottoman places there is an attempt to corelate them with the Byzantine background of the city. The place entries are complemented by bibliographic references – these are not exhaustive, they include the most important titles covering the diverse aspects of each site, with a special emphasis on books and articles that deal with the 16th-century phases of the monuments.
